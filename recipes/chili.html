    <h1>Chili</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili con carne means chili with meat. It might have originated in San Antonio, Texas, in the mid-1800s, although some trace its origins back to the Canary Islands in the 1700s. Immigrants from the Canary Islands settled in San Antonio in the 1800s and may have brought it with them. </p>
    <p>Originally, it was simply meat, sauce, and chili peppers. Eventually, cooks added beans and tomatoes to the dish, although some people are purists and insist that beans do not belong in real chili con carne. Anyway, this recipe is probably pretty good, so don't worry about it too much.</p>
